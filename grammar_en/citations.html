# (1) Define new Variables 
#     - If you want to define a variable start you must start in the first column of the line
#     - Use capital letters for the variables (Non-Terminal-Symbols) and underscore '_'
#     - If you want to use Comments you must use '#' in the first column of the line not second col
#     - As in LaTeX after '#' the rest of the line is a comment
# (2) Multiline Variable Definitions start with the non-terminal Symbol SCI_OBJECTIVE in the first 
#     column with "{" as an opening of the multiline defintion. The end of the multiline definition 
#     is "}" in the first  line of the column, e.g.
#SCI_OBJECTIVE {
#   first line
#   second line
#   third line
#}
#     if the non-terminal symbol is not starting in the first column it will be used as a variable
#     for replacing the symbol with rules of the grammar.
# (3) End of Grammar File
#     - there should be at least two empty lines at the end of each this file
#     - this file will be concated to the grammar-File 'grammar.in' anytime you run createpaper.pl
# (4) If you want to overwrite a definition of a non-terminal Symbol e.g. BIB_KEYWORDS
#     use a starting ">" before non-terminal Symbol e.g
#>BIB_KEYWORDS Risk, Resource
#     overwriting should be used for the following non-terminal symbols
#         - BIB_KEYWORDS

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION {
  Considering the research of RELCITE_AUTHORS CITE_COMMAND in RELCITE_YEAR the RELCITE_TYPE on the topic of RELCITE_TITLE is showing several efforts on PAPER_METHODOLOGY .

} 

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION {
  The area of RELCITE_KEYWORDS was investigated by RELCITE_AUTHORS CITE_COMMAND in RELCITE_YEAR. RELCITE_TITLE is used as a foundation for the further development of SCI_IN_THIS_PAPER.

}

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION {
  IN_THIS_PART we discuss WRD_RELATED research of RELCITE_AUTHORS on 
  RELCITE_TITLE CITE_COMMAND related to PAPER_METHODOLOGY with
  RELCITE_TITLE in RELCITE_YEAR for SCI_OBJECTIVE.

}

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION {
  IN_THIS_PART we consider alternative approach for RELCITE_TITLE of RELCITE_AUTHORS CITE_COMMAND in RELCITE_YEAR as well as other WRD_RELATED work of RELCITE_KEYWORDS mentioned below in the context of SCI_OBJECTIVE.

}

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION {
 In designing SCI_OUR_SYSTEM, we took the WRD_RELATED work CITE_COMMAND 
 of RELCITE_AUTHORS as one starting point because the RELCITE_TYPE focuses 
 on RELCITE_TITLE.

}

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION {
 While RELCITE_AUTHORS CITE_COMMAND in RELCITE_YEAR worked in the 
 studies on RELCITE_KEYWORDS by making efforts in the field of PAPER_PROBLEM by dealing the with RELCITE_TITLE.

}

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION {
 We now compare our SCI_APPROACH for SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM to WRD_RELATED work 
 considering RELCITE_TITLE in SCI_MY_FIELD of RELCITE_AUTHORS 
 CITE_COMMAND (RELCITE_YEAR).

}

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION {
 Our SCI_APPROACH to PAPER_METHODOLOGY is related to research on RELCITE_KEYWORDS. 
 Especially RELCITE_AUTHORS RELCITE_HAVE studied SCI_MY_METHOD in CITE_COMMAND in RELCITE_YEAR 
 by looking at RELCITE_TITLE.

}

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION { 
  LIT_ALTHOUGH RELCITE_AUTHORS also SCI_PRESENT_VERBED this 
  SCI_APPROACH, we SCI_VERBED it based on the ideas in 
 the RELCITE_TYPE (CITE_COMMAND) that focusses 
 on RELCITE_TITLE in RELCITE_YEAR.

}

RELCITE_BOOK_CITATION {
 SCI_MY_METHOD needs the consideration of RELCITE_TITLE, that is related 
 to research on RELCITE_KEYWORDS. Especially RELCITE_AUTHORS RELCITE_HAVE 
 studied SCI_MY_METHOD in CITE_COMMAND in RELCITE_YEAR. This contributes 
 to the objectives PAPER_ALL_OBJECTIVES leads to the application of 
 SCI_A_PROBLEM_ADJ SCI_MY_METHOD.

RELCITE_INTRO {
 LIT_ALTHOUGH we are the first to SCI_PRESENT_VERB RELCITE_KEYWORDS with this 
 approacch of PAPER_METHODOLOGY, much WRD_RELATED work has been devoted to the SCI_MY_METHOD.
}
RELCITE_INTRO SCI_MY_SYSTEM builds on WRD_RELATED work of RELCITE_AUTHORS in RELCITE_YEAR CITE_COMMAND about RELCITE_TITLE.
RELCITE_INTRO The concept of SCI_MY_METHOD has been SCI_VERBED before in the literature by RELCITE_AUTHORS.
RELCITE_INTRO {
 A number of WRD_RELATED publication for RELCITE_KEYWORDS have shown, either for SCI_OPTIMIZATION for the SCI_MY_TODO or 
 as a foundation for the development of PAPER_SYSTYPE_LONG. Especially RELCITE_AUTHORS showed RELCITE_TITLE in CITE_COMMAND 
 in RELCITE_YEAR, that SCI_MY_TODO could benefit from SCI_MY_METHOD.
}
RELCITE_INTRO Several SCI_APPROACH have been proposed in the literature for SCI_MY_TODO. SYS_CITATION contributs to that area of SCI_MY_FIELD.

RELCITE_MID_X RELCITE_AUTHORS SCI_PRESENT_VERBED a comparable implementation of SCI_GENERIC_NOUN to the proposed system for SCI_MY_TODO and SCI_OBJECTIVE
RELCITE_MID_X RELCITE_AUTHORS SCI_PRESENT_VERBED several SCI_BUZZWORD_ADJ SCI_APPROACH_PL CITE_COMMAND, and reported that they have LIT_GREAT WRD_IMPACT  SCI_GENERIC_NOUN by working on RELCITE_TITLE
RELCITE_MID_X the results in this paper are making a contribution to SCI_APPROACH for SCI_MY_TODO building upon the results of RELCITE_AUTHORS published the RELCITE_TYPE on RELCITE_TITLE in RELCITE_YEAR
RELCITE_MID_X PAPER_OBJECTIVE RELCITE_AUTHORS proposed a solution for RELCITE_KEYWORDS which fails to address several key issues that SCI_OUR_SYSTEM has to SCI_PROBLEM_SOLVE. The following section will show our results in detail.
RELCITE_MID_X the PAPER_SYSTEM_VERSION of PAPER_SYSNAME_LONG RELCITE_AUTHORS does not fullfill all the issues for PAPER_OBJECTIVE and PAPER_OBJECTIVE. According to PAPER_PROBLEM SCI_SYS_VERB SCI_GENERIC_NOUN the presented SCI_MY_RESULT contribute to SCI_SOLUTION

BIB_WEATHER_CITATION {
  Although the resolution of the variables DIS_VAR___I, DIS_VAR__II and DIS_VAR_III is not very high,
  the constructed solution for PAPER_OBJECTIVE and PAPER_OBJECTIVE can be explored with prelimenary data
  from http://www.worldweather.org .

}

BIB_MOBILE_PHONES_CITATION {
 SCI_RECENT SCI_RESULTS in 2008 have shown how mobile phones could assist the health self-care. A diabetes case study 
 was explored Preuveneers and Berbers (\cite{1409260})
 based on the idea that mobile phones are available for a high percentage of patients. The development of PAPER_SYSNAME_LONG for 
 SCI_MY_TODO in rural areas could benefit from the availablity of IT-devices.

}

BIB_VECTOR_CONTROL_CITATION {
 Looking on response measures for SCI_DISEASE one option is spraying of insecticides. 
 The determinations areas that require indoor insecticide spraying is an risk and response problem as part of a decision support system.
 For malaria vector control Raktotmanana (\cite{Raktotmanana}) has shown in 2008 how programmes in the Central Highland of Madagascar can 
 provide support for the selection of high priority response areas.

}
 
RELWORK_MID_X {
 The results in this paper are making a contribution to methods of SCI_MY_TODO
 and the determination of temporal and spatial zones for an potential outbreaks of WRD_DISEASE.
 Contribution are based on Tilston, Skelly and Weinstein who focused (\cite{Chikungunya2009Europe}) on Chikungunya surveillance
 and classification of  risk stratified surveillance zones in 2009.

}

BIB_LONG_CITATION {
  For the improvement of SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM  we consider alternative
  well as other existing work mentioned below.
  Remote sensing can provide temporal and spatial maps for environmental conditions that are relevant for the spreading of WRD_DISEASE.
  Geographic information systems (GIS) are used increasingly to process pre-processed satelite images and collected 
  ground data to analyze the geography of environmental variables like DIS_VAR___I, DIS_VAR__II and DIS_VAR_III 
  that is relevant for the disease SCI_DISEASE.
  Cromley \cite{Cromley2003} has shown in 2003 how the relationships between pathological factors 
  in GIS applications can be mapped and analyse geographical distributions of disease agents.
