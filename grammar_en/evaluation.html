# (1) Define new Variables 
#     - If you want to define a variable start you must start in the first column of the line
#     - Use capital letters for the variables (Non-Terminal-Symbols) and underscore '_'
#     - If you want to use Comments you must use '#' in the first column of the line not second col
#     - As in LaTeX after '#' the rest of the line is a comment
# (2) Multiline Variable Definitions start with the non-terminal Symbol SCI_OBJECTIVE in the first 
#     column with "{" as an opening of the multiline defintion. The end of the multiline definition 
#     is "}" in the first  line of the column, e.g.
#SCI_OBJECTIVE {
#   first line
#   second line
#   third line
#}
#     if the non-terminal symbol is not starting in the first column it will be used as a variable
#     for replacing the symbol with rules of the grammar.
# (3) End of Grammar File
#     - there should be at least two empty lines at the end of each this file
#     - this file will be concated to the grammar-File 'grammar.in' anytime you run createpaper.pl
# (4) If you want to overwrite a definition of a non-terminal Symbol e.g. BIB_KEYWORDS
#     use a starting ">" before non-terminal Symbol e.g
#>BIB_KEYWORDS Risk, Resource
#     overwriting should be used for the following non-terminal symbols

EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	In this light, we worked hard to arrive at a suitable evaluation PAPER_METHODOLOGY.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	We did not take problem of the  PAPER_METHODOLOGY seriously enough.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	The objective is to prove that the presented ideas improve the considered SCI_ENVIRONMENT, despite their costs in complexity.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	Only with precise measurements might we convince the reader that performance MATTERS.

SCI_ENVIRONMENT  learning environment of students
SCI_ENVIRONMENT  environment of a living lab for user-driven innovations

EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A1 EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A2

EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	EVALUATING a system in SCI_ENVIRONMENT ours proved DIFFICULT.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	Evaluating complex dynamic systems is difficult, because measurements .
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	How would our system behave in a real-world scenario?
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	Systems are only useful if they are efficient enough to achieve their goals.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	A well designed system that exceeds the limit of an acceptable reponse time will be of no use to the clients.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	Building a PAPER_SYSNAME system is capable to adapt to real-world scenario of the considered SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM has to have an integrated approach of EVALUATION.

EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	According to the SCI_ENVIRONMENT we now discuss our EVALUATION.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	our EVALUATION represents a research contribution for improving the SCI_ENVIRONMENT.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_A	as a consequence of the following paragraph we will see, that the optimization of the SCI_ENVIRONMENT leads to the application of PAPER_THEORY.

PAPER_THEORY mathematical measure theory

EVAL_SEC_INTRO_B	the reason for this is that studies of PAPER_METHODOLOGY have shown in CITATION that EVAL_MEASUREMENT has BETTER_EFFECT SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM than we would be expected by applying standard methods described in CITATION.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_B	the implemented logic follows a spatial model: performance of learning algorithms MATTERS only as long as CONSTRAINT_TAKES a back seat to CONSTRAINT_OR_MEASUREMENT.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_B	TAKE_NOTE_THAT we have intentionally neglected to SCI_VERB PROP_OR_MEASUREMENT.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_B	TAKE_NOTE_THAT we have decided not to SCI_VERB PROP_OR_MEASUREMENT.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_B	only with the benefit of our system's PROP_OR_MEASUREMENT might we optimize for CONSTRAINT_TYPE at the cost of CONSTRAINT_OR_MEASUREMENT.
EVAL_SEC_INTRO_B 	we are grateful for SCI_MATH_ADJ SCI_THING_P; without them, we could not optimize for CONSTRAINT_TYPE simultaneously with CONSTRAINT_OR_MEASUREMENT.

EVAL_HARDWARE_INTRO	{
now we list the user OpenSource software and explain the modification of the standard OpenSource software components that were necessary:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item OSSYS_I is a OSTYPE_I and it OSSYS_I is used for OSSYS_DESCRIBE_I
 \item OSSYS_II is a OSTYPE_II and it OSSYS_II is used for OSSYS_DESCRIBE_II

EVAL_HARDWARE_INTRO	a well-tuned network setup holds the key to a useful EVALUATION.
EVAL_HARDWARE_INTRO	though many important details PROVIDED by BIB_CITATION, we can derive the PAPER_METHODOLOGY by considering the following aspects.
EVAL_HARDWARE_INTRO	{
 we must emphasis that in network PAPER_CLIENT_P configuration and replication on PAPER_SYSNAME must 
 be possible without licensing problems by using OpenSource software and/or libraries. 
 This determines the environment to get the results.

EVAL_SEC_SOFTWARE_END	we note that researchers have tried and failed to enable this functionality.
EVAL_SEC_SOFTWARE_END	this concludes our discussion of necessary modifications of the proposed PAPER_SYSNAME for SCI_MY_TODO.
EVAL_SEC_SOFTWARE_END	all of the techniques mentioned above are of significance for SCI_MY_TODO. SCI_CITE_AUTHOR shows in \cite{cTECHNIK}  that investigated PAPER_METHODOLOGY can be used in a SIMILAR SETUP for SCI_MY_TODO.

EVAL_SEC_SOFTWARE_INTRO	We ran and tested SCI_OUR_SYSTEM on the different operating systems and installed ALL_SOFTWARE_NAMES
EVAL_SEC_SOFTWARE_INTRO	Building a sufficiently tested software environment takes time and needs to be evaluated before a beta-release of the environment. The current version will show all areas of the final version in terms functionality even if some features are missing. 
EVAL_SEC_SOFTWARE_INTRO	The software ALL_SOFTWARE_NAMES used for testing SOFTWARE_PROP. The final impact on the performance of the system could not evaluated so far; our work here follows the basic configuration of interfaces between the used software environments.

#EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE note that the PAPER_METHODOLOGY applied on SCI_MY_TODO in EXP_FIG, exhibiting DIFFERENT EVAL_MEASUREMENT
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE note that the PAPER_METHODOLOGY applied on SCI_MY_TODO, exhibiting DIFFERENT EVAL_MEASUREMENT
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE the given points in the domain are mapped to a real number and in the graphs these points were interpolated to a surface. The interpolation PROVIDES a DIFFERENT EVAL_MEASUREMENT introduced with the SCI_APPLICATION to SCI_GOAL_ACHIEVE PAPER_OBJECTIVE and PAPER_OBJECTIVE. 
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE the prototype version of the proposed system caused an unstable behavior throughout the experiments
# EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE Gaussian electromagnetic disturbances in our EXP_WHERE caused unstable experimental results
# EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE operator error alone cannot account for these results
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE these EVAL_MEASUREMENT observations contrast to those seen in earlier work in the BIB_CITATION.
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE note how OPTIMIZING of SCI_MY_TODO produces along with this iterative process a reproducible measure for quality of the results
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE the results come from trial runs of a prototype PAPER_SYSNAME that were reproducible
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE measures for errors of PAPER_SYSNAME_LONG will be derived by application of PAPER_THEORY and the error measure is used for SCI_OPTIMIZATION adjusting the parameters of modules in PAPER_SYSNAME. 
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE note that the following paragraph shows the \textit{STAT_ADJ} and not \textit{STAT_ADJ} SCI_MATH_ADJ HARDWARE_PROP_OR_MEASUREMENT
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE note that in addition to the error measures the standard deviations of the collected data from the mathematical mapping show the accuracy and quality of prediction of PAPER_SYSNAME.
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE the INTERPOLATION for SCI_MY_METHOD shows the application of OSSYS_I which is a known OSTYPE_I we used for evaluation with PAPER_THEORY
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE we anticipated the results from a mathematical point of view by modelling convergence in a topological space. However this has to be shown that the implementation of the methods provide the same results in this phase of the EVALUATION
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE of course, all sensitive data was anonymized during all test of PAPER_OBJECTIVE and PAPER_OBJECTIVE
# EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE note that SCI_OUR_SYSTEM has SMOOTHER HARDWARE_PROP_OR_MEASUREMENT curves than do HACKED SCI_THING_P
# EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE the key to EXP_FIG is closing the feedback loop; EXP_FIG shows how SCI_OUR_SYSTEM's HARDWARE_PROP_OR_MEASUREMENT does not converge otherwise
EVAL_ANALYZE_ONE the data in our evaluation, in particular, proves that the application of PAPER_THEORY provides only a QUALITY_OF_IMPROVEMENT improvement of PAPER_SYSNAME_LONG
