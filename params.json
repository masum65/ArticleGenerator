{"name":"Articlegenerator","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages of ArticleGenerator.\r\nThis automatic document generator is prototype to check the features of Paper Generator in general. The context depended grammar is based on the Grammar developed for the bogus paper generator of the [SCIgen Project](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/#examples), for which the team was able to get the random paper accepted at the conference and by donation they went to the conference and held a random generated talk. In contrast to the random generated paper of SCIgen the selected approach should support the template generation of papers. Currently the tool is just a proof of concept and not designed for real paper generation. The basic idea could support the paper generation e.g. together with R-Statistice or a Wizzard similar to the user support implemented in [SOFA-Statistic Software](http://www.sofastatistics.com/home.php), and publish. After your document or paper is generated, you can check out the statistics of your date locally. \r\nCurrently the statistics is not implement and the user interface for just using the Article generator has just \r\n\r\n### Quality of Grammar\r\nThe quality of the grammar is very poor to avoid misuse for real paper submission. So people have to develop the grammar on their own. This increases the workload for users and reduces the possibilty of misuse.\r\n\r\n### Creating LaTeX documents \r\nIf you prefer to not use the article/paper generator, just download the Paper Generator form the repository as ZIP-File and to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, ArticleGenerator support LaTeX as main export format for further editing. Play around with the grammar and use the Hello World example as simple grammar to understand the basic principle.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe ArticleGenerator was designed as proof of concept for dynamic evolutionary paper generation.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
