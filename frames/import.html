# (1) Define new Variables 
#     - If you want to define a variable start you must start in the first column of the line
#     - Use capital letters for the variables (Non-Terminal-Symbols) and underscore '_'
#     - If you want to use Comments you must use '#' in the first column of the line not second col
#     - As in LaTeX after '#' the rest of the line is a comment
# (2) Multiline Variable Definitions start with the non-terminal Symbol SCI_OBJECTIVE in the first 
#     column with "{" as an opening of the multiline defintion. The end of the multiline definition 
#     is "}" in the first  line of the column, e.g.
#SCI_OBJECTIVE {
#   first line
#   second line
#   third line
#}
#     if the non-terminal symbol is not starting in the first column it will be used as a variable
#     for replacing the symbol with rules of the grammar.
# (3) End of Grammar File
#     - there should be at least two empty lines at the end of each this file
#     - this file will be concated to the grammar-File 'grammar.in' anytime you run createpaper.pl
# (4) If you want to overwrite a definition of a non-terminal Symbol e.g. BIB_KEYWORDS
#     use a starting ">" before non-terminal Symbol e.g
#>BIB_KEYWORDS Risk, Resource
#     overwriting should be used for the following non-terminal symbols
#         - BIB_KEYWORDS

SC_AB_SITUATION PAPER_PRECONDITION CAN_BE_CHARACTERIZED_BY PAPER_PROBLEM.
SC_AB_SITUATION Considering PAPER_SYSAREA applied on NOUN_PROBLEM is linked to the SCI_DEVELOPMENT of PAPER_SYSTYPE_LONG (PAPER_SYSTYPE).
SC_AB_SITUATION NOUN_PROBLEM in field of PAPER_SYSAREA needs improvement by SCI_DEVELOPMENT of PAPER_SYSTYPE_LONG (PAPER_SYSTYPE).

SCI_AB_A_START SCI_IN_THIS_PAPER, we SCI_PROVE_VERB the WRD_EFFICIENCY of SCI_MY_FIELD.
SCI_AB_A_START SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM is a complex scientific field of optimization for which PAPER_METHODOLOGY could applied by implementing PAPER_SYSNAME.
SCI_AB_A_START To accomplish a SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM with PAPER_SYSNAME it is necessary an approach to adapt selected methods from SCI_FIELD.
SCI_AB_A_START In the paper the analysis of PAPER_PRECONDITION provides the requirements and constraints for SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM.
SCI_AB_A_START The application of PAPER_METHODOLOGY needs evidence for the optimisation for PAPER_SYSNAME.. 

SCI_AB_A_CONSEQUENCE According to the SCI_OBJECTIVE of optimization of SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM we SCI_PROVE_VERB that PAPER_SYSNAME supports the 

SCI_AB_A_END , which leads to PAPER_METHOD_IMPROVEMENT for PAPER_PROBLEM
SCI_AB_A_END , which embodies the SCI_MATH_ADJ principles of SCI_MY_FIELD

SCI_ABS_A SCI_IN_THIS_PAPER it will be shown that PAPER_SYSNAME provides support for PAPER_OBJECTIVE.
SCI_ABS_A In recent years, much research has been devoted to SCI_MY_FIELD. LIT_REVERSAL, a few results have SCI_VERBED the SCI_OPTIMIZATION for PAPER_OBJECTIVE.
SCI_ABS_A PAPER_SYSNAME and PAPER_TITLE were considered with the focus on PAPER_THEORY.  Especially SCI_MY_FIELD was applied on SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM for PAPER_OBJECTIVE in the last few years.
SCI_ABS_A The SCI_ACT is a SCI_ADJ SCI_PROBLEM, that CAN_BE_CHARACTERIZED_BY SCI_OBJECTIVE PAPER_OBJECTIVE .
SCI_ABS_A The requirements for objective for PAPER_OBJECTIVE has far-reaching implications on PAPER_PROBLEM. This will be considered in this PAPER_TYPE .
SCI_ABS_A Generalizations of PAPER_OBJECTIVE have led to many advances in SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM with PAPER_PRECONDITION, including SCI_MY_FIELD and SCI_A_PROBLEM_ADJ SCI_OPTIMIZATION .
SCI_ABS_A The SCI_ACT has SCI_VERBED SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM, and current research suggests that the SCI_ACT will SCI_OPTIMIZE PAPER_OBJECTIVE.
SCI_ABS_B The SCI_MY_FIELD with PAPER_METHODOLOGY lead to the OPTIMIZING of PAPER_SYSNAME_LONG for PAPER_OBJECTIVE . The results will be defined not only by the PAPER_PROBLEM, but also by the need for the SCI_SOLUTION.
SCI_ABS_B Recent advances in SCI_MY_METHOD and SCI_MY_TODO SCI_ABS_ACT PAPER_OBJECTIVE.
SCI_ABS_B The results in this PAPER_TYPE SCI_MY_RESULT are an interesting new topic in the field of SCI_MY_FIELD for PAPER_OBJECTIVE.
SCI_ABS_B Many results for PAPER_CLIENT_P have shown that the problem of PAPER_PROBLEM can not be solved by PAPER_THEORY alone, but also an SCI_A_PROBLEM_ADJ representation of knowledge might contribute to the PAPER_OBJECTIVE.
SCI_ABS_B The obejctive PAPER_OBJECTIVE needs contributions to SCI_MY_FIELD for successful improvement for SCI_MY_TODO. The QUALITY_OF_IMPROVEMENT positive effects arise for SCI_FOR_WHOM but it has to be shown is this article that the effects can generalize the results for SCI_SOLUTION.
SCI_ABS_BThe development of PAPER_SYSTYPE_LONG for accomplishing PAPER_OBJECTIVE implies the consideration of PAPER_METHOD_IMPROVEMENT applied on PAPER_CLIENT_P.
