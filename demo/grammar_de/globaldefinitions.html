# (1) Define new Variables 
#     - If you want to define a variable start you must start in the first column of the line
#     - Use capital letters for the variables (Non-Terminal-Symbols) and underscore '_'
#     - If you want to use Comments you must use '#' in the first column of the line not second col
#     - As in LaTeX after '#' the rest of the line is a comment
# (2) Multiline Variable Definitions start with the non-terminal Symbol SCI_OBJECTIVE in the first 
#     column with "{" as an opening of the multiline defintion. The end of the multiline definition 
#     is "}" in the first  line of the column, e.g.
#SCI_OBJECTIVE {
#   first line
#   second line
#   third line
#}
#     if the non-terminal symbol is not starting in the first column it will be used as a variable
#     for replacing the symbol with rules of the grammar.
# (3) End of Grammar File
#     - there should be at least two empty lines at the end of each this file
#     - this file will be concated to the grammar-File 'grammar.in' anytime you run createpaper.pl
# (4) If you want to overwrite a definition of a non-terminal Symbol e.g. BIB_KEYWORDS
#     use a starting ">" before non-terminal Symbol e.g
#>BIB_KEYWORDS Risk, Resource
#     overwriting should be used for the following non-terminal symbols
#         - BIB_KEYWORDS
#

SCIDEF_INTRO_DEFINTION Now we will define SCIDEF_KEYWORD that is used in the context of SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM.
SCIDEF_INTRO_DEFINTION Before we are continuing the analysis of PAPER_PROBLEM we have to define SCIDEF_KEYWORD.
SCIDEF_MISSING_DEFINITION SCI_DEFBEGIN[SCIDEF_KEYWORD] Let ... be a ... and ... has the property of ... then ... is called SCIDEF_KEYWORD SCI_DEFEND

SCI_DEF_HEALTHSERVICEDELIVERY {

 Health Service Delivery will be used in the following broad definition for SCI_MY_TODO.

 SCI_DEFBEGIN[Health Service Delivery] \label{label:HealthServiceDelivery} Let 
 \textit{R} be a set of resources that can be used for fulfilling a  set of geocoded demands 
 \textit{D} for medical or health related goods or services. 
  Health Service Delivery is a methodology, to use the available resources \textit{R} to cover the demands 
 \textit{D}.

SCI_DEF_LIVINGLABS {

 In Living Labs, users or citizens are seen as a source of new innovations, as co-creators of new services and products, typically linked to the creation or application of ICTs or ICT-enabled services. The term Living Lab has emerged in parallel from the Ambient Intelligence research communities context and from the discussion on Experience and Application Research (EAR) based on the concept of user experience and Ambient Intelligence (AmI) [de Ruyter et al., 2007]. However the thinking and practice behind Living Labs has been developed by Prof. William Mitchell, Media Lab and School of Architecture and city planning, MIT Boston, who argued that a Living Lab represents a user-centric research methodology for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts (Corelabs, 2006). 
 Over the last few years the term has been promoted and implemented by the EU which has resulted in the creation of the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL), which in 2008 has expanded also beyond European borders (ENoLL, 2010). Its mission is to help create first class innovation environments for ICT-based products, services and social innovations and facilitate innovation and collaboration between users, industry and research stakeholders.  
 
 SCI_DEFBEGIN[Living Labs] \label{label:LivingLab} 
 Five key dimensions of Living Labs that are seen by ENoLL (2008) as 
 \begin{enumerate} 
   \item
   innovation settings (open innovation environment), 
   \item
   operating environments (real-life settings), 
   \item
   affecting innovation processes (user-driven innovation and co-creation process), 
   \item
   related to user engagement and 
   \item
   from which innovation outcomes are expected (new services, products and societal infrastructures).  
 \end{enumerate} 
 
 Nowadays, several Living Lab descriptions and definitions are available from different sources (CoreLabs, 2006; Niitamo, et al. 2006; Pallot, et al., 2008; Schumacher \& Feurstein, 2008; European Commission Information society and media, 2009). It is a concept which refers to a research and development methodology where innovations such as services, products and application enhancements are created and validated in collaborative, multi-contextual empirical real-world settings (Eriksson, Niitamo \& Kulkki, 2005). Concepts also evident from various definitions of LL are open innovation ecosystems, territorial contexts, concurrent research and innovation processes(Folstad, 2008). 
 Living Labs will apply normally the following innovation life cycle as illustrated below (ENoLL, 2008)

SCI_DEF_DECISIONSUPPORTSYSTEM {
 Decision Support Systems are considered in the field of PAPER_PRECONDITION.

 SCI_DEFBEGIN[Decision Support System] \label{label:DecisionSupportSystem} Let \textit{D} the available data for a decision making process und \textit{S} be a decision space, containing the possible options for a decision maker to make a decision based on data \textit{D}. 
 A system that has the property to reduce the decision space \textit{S} to a subset \textit{S'} of option is called Decision Support System. 
 SCI_DEFEND

 Decision Support Systems are used in complex dynamic systems like SCI_MY_TODO with SCI_MY_METHOD and 
 the DSS does not make decisions on its own it supports the decision maker in reducing the decision space \textit{S} to \textit{S'} of preprocesses the data, so that it easier to find an better decision 
 decisions from \textit{S} than without the DSS. 
 We have to SCI_MY_RESULT . 

}

SCI_DEF_GISTAILOREDQUESTIONAIRE {
 Spatial Decision Support Systems consist of a Geographic Information System (GIS) and Decision Support System (DSS). The Decision Support needs data for updating and evaluating the decision support.
 For PAPER_PRECONDITION data aquisition is expensive, so reducing the time for completing the questionnaire and further on the willingness of users with time constraints to provide the data.


 SCI_DEFBEGIN[GIS tailored Questionnaire] \label{label:GIStailorQuest} Let \textit{Q} be domain the questions for a questionnaire can be taken. 
 \textit{Q'} is subset of the questions that is used in a questionnaire. A GIS-tailored questionnaire is generated with the use of Geographic Information
 System (GIS), where the selection of 
 that selects \textit{Q'} as a subset of \textit{Q} is determined by spatial properties in the GIS.
