# (1) Define new Variables 
#     - If you want to define a variable start you must start in the first column of the line
#     - Use capital letters for the variables (Non-Terminal-Symbols) and underscore '_'
#     - If you want to use Comments you must use '#' in the first column of the line not second col
#     - As in LaTeX after '#' the rest of the line is a comment
# (2) Multiline Variable Definitions start with the non-terminal Symbol SCI_OBJECTIVE in the first 
#     column with "{" as an opening of the multiline defintion. The end of the multiline definition 
#     is "}" in the first  line of the column, e.g.
#SCI_OBJECTIVE {
#   first line
#   second line
#   third line
#}
#     if the non-terminal symbol is not starting in the first column it will be used as a variable
#     for replacing the symbol with rules of the grammar.
# (3) End of Grammar File
#     - there should be at least two empty lines at the end of each this file
#     - this file will be concated to the grammar-File 'grammar.in' anytime you run createpaper.pl
# (4) If you want to overwrite a definition of a non-terminal Symbol e.g. BIB_KEYWORDS
#     use a starting ">" before non-terminal Symbol e.g
#>BIB_KEYWORDS Risk, Resource
#     overwriting should be used for the following non-terminal symbols
#         - BIB_KEYWORDS

RELWORK_INTRO In this section, we discuss WRD_RELATED research into SCI_MY_FIELD for PAPER_PROBLEM RELWORK_XXX
RELWORK_INTRO In this section, we consider alternative SCI_SYSTEM_PL as well as WRD_RELATED work.
RELWORK_INTRO We now consider WRD_RELATED work.
RELWORK_INTRO In designing SCI_OUR_SYSTEM, we based the conceptual work on WRD_RELATED work from a number of distinct areas of PAPER_SYSAREA and PAPER_THEORY.

RELWORK_INTRO while we know of no other studies on PAPER_TITLE, several efforts have been made to SCI_VERB SCI_MY_FIELD
RELWORK_INTRO we now compare our SCI_APPROACH to WRD_RELATED SCI_A_PROBLEM_ADJ SCI_APPROACH_PL RELWORK_XXX
RELWORK_INTRO our SCI_APPROACH is related to research into SCI_MY_TODO with PAPER_PROBLEM RELWORK_XXX
RELWORK_INTRO the SCI_VERBION of SCI_GENERIC_NOUN has been widely studied RELWORK_XXX
RELWORK_INTRO LIT_ALTHOUGH we are the first to SCI_PRESENT_VERB SCI_GENERIC_NOUN in this light, much WRD_RELATED work has been devoted to the SCI_ACT 
RELWORK_INTRO SCI_OUR_SYSTEM builds on WRD_RELATED work in area of  PAPER_SYSAREA with PAPER_PROBLEM RELWORK_XXX
RELWORK_INTRO the concept of PAPER_PROBLEM has been SCI_VERBED before in the literature RELWORK_XXX
RELWORK_INTRO a major source of our inspiration is early work of ........ mentioned below RELWORK_XXX
RELWORK_INTRO a number of WRD_RELATED SCI_SYSTEM_PL have SCI_VERBED SCI_GENERIC_NOUN, either for the SCI_ACT REL_EMPTY_CITATION or for the SCI_ACT
RELWORK_INTRO Several SCI_A_PROBLEM_ADJ SCI_SYSTEM_PL have been proposed in the literature RELWORK_XXX
RELWORK_INTRO RELWORK_MID_X RELWORK_XXX

RELWORK_MID LIT_MIDDLE_MAYBE RELWORK_MID_X RELWORK_XXX
RELWORK_MID_X LIT_ALTHOUGH SCI_BY_WHO also SCI_PRESENT_VERBED this SCI_APPROACH, we SCI_VERBED it independently and simultaneously
RELWORK_MID_X SCI_BY_WHO REL_EMPTY_CITATION and SCI_BY_WHO REL_EMPTY_CITATION SCI_PRESENT_VERBED the first known instance of SCI_GENERIC_NOUN
RELWORK_MID_X a recent published results ........... SCI_PRESENT_VERBED a similar idea for SCI_GENERIC_NOUN for PAPER_SYSNAME_LONG
RELWORK_MID_X recent work ......... suggests a SCI_SYSTEM for PAPER_OBJECTIVE, but does not offer an implementation
RELWORK_MID_X SCI_BY_WHO SCI_PRESENT_VERBED several SCI_BUZZWORD_ADJ SCI_APPROACH_PL for PAPER_PRECONDITION, and reported that they have LIT_GREAT WRD_IMPACT  on SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM
RELWORK_MID_X we had our SCI_APPROACH for SCI_IMPROVED_SYSTEM derived from BIB_CITATIONS before SCI_BY_WHO published the recent work on SCI_GENERIC_NOUN
RELWORK_MID_X SCI_OVERALL_THESIS_THING the following published work proposed by SCI_BY_WHO fails to address several key issues that SCI_OUR_SYSTEM does SCI_PROBLEM_SOLVE
RELWORK_MID_X the PAPER_SYSTEM_VERSION of SCI_SYSTEM SCI_BY_WHO_SOMETIMES does not SCI_SYS_VERB SCI_GENERIC_NOUN as well as our SCI_APPROACH
RELWORK_MID_X unlike many WRD_RELATED SCI_APPROACH_PL SYS_CITATION, we do not attempt to SCI_SYS_VERB or SCI_SYS_VERB SCI_GENERIC_NOUN
RELWORK_MID_X instead of SCI_VERBING SCI_GENERIC_NOUN SYS_CITATION, we SCI_SOLVE_CLAUSE simply by SCI_VERBING SCI_GENERIC_NOUN
RELWORK_MID_X the choice of SCI_MY_FIELD in REL_EMPTY_CITATION differs from ours in that we SCI_VERB only SCI_ADJ SCI_BUZZWORD_NOUN in SCI_OUR_SYSTEM
RELWORK_MID_X SCI_BY_WHO REL_EMPTY_CITATION originally articulated the need for SCI_GENERIC_NOUN
RELWORK_MID_X the original SCI_APPROACH to this SCI_PROBLEM SCI_BY_WHO_SOMETIMES was SCI_REACTION; LIT_REVERSAL, SCI_WHAT did not completely SCI_SOLVE_CLAUSE
RELWORK_MID_X SCI_BY_WHO REL_EMPTY_CITATION suggested a scheme for SCI_VERBING SCI_GENERIC_NOUN, but did not fully realize the implications of SCI_GENERIC_NOUN at the time
RELWORK_MID_X SCI_OUR_SYSTEM is broadly related to work in the field of SCI_MY_FIELD SCI_BY_WHO_SOMETIMES, but we view it from a new perspective for PAPER_OBJECTIVE
RELWORK_MID_X SCI_BY_WHO REL_EMPTY_CITATION developed a similar SCI_SYSTEM, LIT_REVERSAL we SCI_PROVE_VERBED that SCI_OUR_SYSTEM SCI_PROOF_PROP 
RELWORK_MID_X a collection of WRD_RELATED work supports the implementation of our selected features of PAPER_SYSNAME_LONG

RELWORK_FILLER LIT_CONCLUSION, comparisons to PAPER_OBJECTIVE we will consider PAPER_PRECONDITION.
RELWORK_FILLER LIT_REVERSAL, without concrete evidence, there is no reason to believe these claims.
RELWORK_FILLER SCI_OUR_SYSTEM represents a significant advance above this work.
RELWORK_FILLER it remains to be seen how valuable this research is to the SCI_FIELD community.
RELWORK_FILLER this SCI_APPROACH is MORE SCI_EXPENSIVE than ours.
RELWORK_FILLER without using SCI_GENERIC_NOUN, it is hard to imagine that SCI_OVERALL_THESIS_PROVE.
RELWORK_FILLER our design avoids this overhead.
RELWORK_FILLER a comprehensive survey CITATION is available in this space.
RELWORK_FILLER this work follows a long line of WRD_RELATED SCI_SYSTEM_PL, all of which have failed REL_EMPTY_CITATION.
RELWORK_FILLER this is arguably SCI_FAIR.
RELWORK_FILLER the only other noteworthy work in this area suffers from SCI_FAIR assumptions about SCI_GENERIC_NOUN REL_EMPTY_CITATION.
RELWORK_FILLER SCI_OUR_SYSTEM also SCI_SYSTEM_ACTION, but without all the unnecssary complexity.
RELWORK_FILLER CONSTRAINT_TYPE aside, SCI_OUR_SYSTEM SCI_VERBS MORE accurately.
RELWORK_FILLER we believe there is room for both schools of thought within the field of SCI_FIELD.
RELWORK_FILLER LIT_ALTHOUGH this work was published before ours, we came up with the SCI_APPROACH first but could not publish it until now due to red tape. 
RELWORK_FILLER SCI_IN_THIS_PAPER, we SCI_PROBLEM_SOLVED all of the SCI_PROBLEM_PL inherent in the WRD_RELATED work.
RELWORK_FILLER LIT_REVERSAL, the complexity of their SCI_APPROACH grows SCI_GROWTH_ADV as SCI_GENERIC_NOUN grows.
RELWORK_FILLER LIT_CONCLUSION, if PERFORMANCE is a concern, SCI_OUR_SYSTEM has a clear advantage.

RELWORK_CONCL In general, SCI_OUR_SYSTEM outperformed all WRD_RELATED SCI_SYSTEM_PL in this area PAPER_METHODOLOGY.
RELWORK_CONCL LIT_CONCLUSION, the class of SCI_SYSTEM_PL enabled by SCI_OUR_SYSTEM is fundamentally different from WRD_RELATED SCI_APPROACH_PL 
RELWORK_CONCL LIT_LAST note that SCI_SYSTEM_PROP will contribute to LIT_CONCLUSION. WRD_FURTHERMORE SCI_OUR_SYSTEM will WRD_PROVE the SCI_OPTIMISATION according PAPER_ALL_OBJECTIVES.  
RELWORK_CONCL LIT_REVERSAL, these SCI_APPROACH_PL are entirely orthogonal to our efforts.
RELWORK_CONCL we plan to adopt many of the ideas from this WRD_RELATED work in future versions of SCI_OUR_SYSTEM.
RELWORK_CONCL all of these SCI_APPROACH_PL conflict with our assumption that SCI_GENERIC_NOUN and SCI_GENERIC_NOUN are SCI_ADJ SCI_MY_TODO
RELWORK_CONCL our SCI_APPROACH to SCI_GENERIC_NOUN differs from that of SCI_BY_WHO REL_EMPTY_CITATION as well as PAPER_OBJECTIVE
RELWORK_CONCL LIT_ALTHOUGH we have nothing against the WRD_RELATED SCI_APPROACH SCI_BY_WHO_SOMETIMES, we do not believe that SCI_APPROACH is applicable to SCI_MY_FIELD 
RELWORK_CONCL these SCI_SYSTEM_PL typically require that SCI_OVERALL_THESIS_PROVE REL_EMPTY_CITATION, and we SCI_PROVE_VERBED SCI_IN_THIS_PAPER that this, indeed, is the case.
RELWORK_CONCL SCI_B_LEADIN_C the SCI_SYSTEM of SCI_BY_WHO REL_EMPTY_CITATION is a SCI_ADJ choice for SCI_GENERIC_NOUN 
RELWORK_CONCL LIT_CONCLUSION, despite substantial work in this area, our SCI_APPROACH is SCI_ADV the SCI_SYSTEM of choice among SCI_PEOPLE for PAPER_OBJECTIVE
