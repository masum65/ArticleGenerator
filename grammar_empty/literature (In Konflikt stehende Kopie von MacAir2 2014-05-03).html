The prototype has been part of an e-commerce-related project and implements the mapping of business process models to workflow schemata. A meta-modelling tool has been used for implementing a modelling tool and the mapping. The analysis of the mapping is based on finding equivalent concepts in the source (MEMO-OrgML) and the target language (XPDL). Features which are not available in the source language have been added using special language elements. The paper also presents the idea of a generic mapping approach. Mappings from business process models to other process-oriented representations can be realised. The realisation of these mappings is similar to our approach. We will extend our tool with respect to support different target languages like BPEL4WS. The meta-modelling tool MetaEdit  has been used for the prototypes.},

  abstract = {One important feature of the gene expression data is that the number of genes m far exceeds the number of samples n. When applied to analyse the gene expression data, standard statistical methods do not work well when n < m. Development of new methodologies or modification of existing methodologies is needed for the analysis of microarray data. Support vector machine (SVM) has been applied in gene expression data classification. In traditional SVM classification, a classifier is usually built by a small subset of samples called support vectors. This may cause a loss of available information since the number of samples in a gene expression dataset is usually very small. In this paper, we introduce a logistic support vector machine (LSVM) algorithm for the classification task. In LSVM, all the samples are used as support vectors and parameters are estimated via the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation procedure. The proposed algorithm also has the advantage of providing an estimate of the underlying probability. This algorithm was applied to five different gene expression datasets. Computational results show that compared with popular classification methods such as traditional SVM, our algorithm usually leads to an improvement in classification accuracy.},

  abstract = {Background Telemedical networks that apply innovative mobile information technologies (IT) are an innovative approach to improve stroke care in community settings. Within the German Stroke Angel initiative and the research project PerCoMed (Pervasive Computing in Medical Care, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, http://www.percomed.de) the effects of such a solution were assessed by an interdisciplinary research approach. The main goal of the team of researchers and practitioners was to provide clear evidence of improvements in intersectional processes of the stroke chain survival, namely in the acute stroke processes between prehospital rescue services and hospital stroke units. Material and methods Between October 2005 and October 2007 the paramedical staff of five rescue service transporters in a rural area of northern Bavaria was included in a network with the stroke unit of the Neurological Clinic Bad Neustadt. Telemedical support by the Stroke Angel computing system &#8211; a software running on a personal digital assistant (PDA) to transmit patient data from the rescue team to the hospital during patient transporting time &#8211; was established. As procedural guidance, the Stroke Angel system suggests a predefined path through the necessary emergency procedures according to the structure of the mandatory protocol and the implemented Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS). Results In the empirical study the authors obtained a complete data set of 226 consecutively admitted patients for analysis in Bad Neustadt and LAPSS data of 217 patients from a second scenario in D{\"u}sseldorf. Medical, economic and technical analyses were applied. The technological robustness of the Stroke Angel system could be proven and information entered was transmitted fully and correctly. Concerning medical research questions, for both scenario locations LAPSS with a sensitivity of 68.3% and a specificity of 85.1% has to be deemed insufficient. Hence, alternative algorithms will have to be used in the next steps of evaluation. The system significantly influenced the clinical process of acute stroke management more than the preclinical ones (door-to-CT: 32 min. before and 16 min. at the end of the project). Lysis treatment rose from 6.12% (2005) to 11.17% (2007) of patients with acute stroke. Conclusions From the set of perspectives taken, the study illustrates that mobile computing technologies offer new and innovative approaches to improve intersectional acute stroke care. It also teaches the participants that interdisciplinary research can significantly deepen the understanding of such technologies and projects, which can lead to better decision making concerning solution implementation, management and improvements. The approach will be brought into daily practice in Bad Neustadt/Saale within the next months.},

The GIS based generation of a questionnaire is used to provide tailored information for informed decision making in health care systems. Resource Management can only be optimized if the ICT-based representation is based on tailored information according to the area in which the process of optimization should be performed. Areas with a lack of resources and with heterogeneous environmental and social conditions should get a tailored response based on tailored information, which can be provided by this type of questionnaire.

SAMPLE POPULATION: Reports of skunks that had been submitted for rabies testing in Texas from 1953 through 2007. PROCEDURES: Reports were reviewed to obtain information on seasonality of rabies in skunks, seasonality of human and domestic animal exposure to rabid skunks, commonly reported clinical signs of rabies in skunks, domestic animals frequently exposed to rabid skunks, common scenarios for exposure of domestic animals to rabid skunks, disposition of domestic animals exposed to rabid skunks, age and gender of humans exposed to rabid skunks, and usual routes of exposure of humans to rabid skunks. RESULTS: On a yearly basis, the number of rabid skunks peaked in 1961, 1979, and 2001. On a monthly basis, the number of rabid skunks peaked in March and April. Over the study period, the percentage of rabid skunks from urban areas increased and the percentage from rural areas decreased. Striped skunks were the most common species. Dogs and cats were the domestic animals most frequently exposed to rabid skunks. On average, the highest numbers of humans exposed to rabid skunks were between 36 and 50 years old. Most humans were exposed through means other than a bite. Typical behaviors of rabid skunks were entering a dog pen, appearing outside during daytime, and attacking pets. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Information on the epidemiology of rabies in skunks may be useful in planning and implementing local, state, and national rabies control and prevention campaigns.},

  abstract = {A common assumption about malaria, dengue, and other mosquito-borne infections is that the two main components

of the risk of human infection the rate at which people are bitten (human biting rate) and the proportion of

mosquitoes that are infectious are positively correlated. In fact, these two risk factors are generated by different

processes and may be negatively correlated across space and time in heterogeneous environments. Uneven

distribution of blood-meal hosts and larval habitat creates a spatial mosaic of demographic sources and sinks.

Moreover, mosquito populations fluctuate temporally, forced by environmental variables such as rainfall, temperature,

and humidity. These sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the distribution of mosquito populations

generate variability in the human biting rate, in the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious, and in the risk of

human infection. To understand how heterogeneity affects the epidemiology of mosquito-borne infections, we

developed a set of simple models that incorporate heterogeneity in a stepwise fashion. These models predict that the human biting rate is highest shortly after the mosquito densities peak, near breeding sites where adult mosquitoes emerge, and around the edges of areas where humans are aggregated. In contrast, the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious reflects the age structure of mosquito populations; it peaks where old mosquitoes are found, far from mosquito breeding habitat, and when mosquito population density is declining. Finally, we show that estimates for the average risk of infection that are based on the average entomological inoculation rate are strongly biased in heterogeneous environments.},

Methods: In each of six Asian cities or periurban areas, a team randomly selected urban clusters for conducting standardized household surveys, neighbourhood background surveys and entomological surveys. They collected information on vector breeding sites, people�s knowledge, attitudes and practices surrounding dengue, and the characteristics of the study areas. All premises were inspected; larval indices were used to quantify vector breeding sites, and pupal counts were used to identify productive water container types and as a proxy measure for adult vector abundance.

Findings: The most productive vector breeding sites were outdoor water containers, particularly if uncovered, beneath shrubbery and unused for at least one week. Peridomestic and intradomestic areas were much more important for pupal production than commercial and public spaces other than schools and religious facilities. A complex but non-significant association was found between water supply and pupal counts, and lack of waste disposal services was associated with higher vector abundance in only one site. Greater knowledge about dengue and its transmission was associated with lower mosquito breeding and production. Vector control measures (mainly larviciding in one site) substantially reduced larval and pupal counts and �pushed� mosquito breeding to alternative containers.

Conclusion: Vector breeding and the production of adult Aedes aegypti are influenced by a complex interplay of factors. Thus, to achieve effective vector management, a public health response beyond routine larviciding or focal spraying is essential.},

It is assumed that when infection rate increases, the risk of arbovirus transmission to humans and animals also increases. We examined some of the factors that can invalidate this assumption. First, we used a model to illustrate how the proportion of mosquitoes capable of virus transmission, or infectious, is not a constant fraction of the number of infected mosquitoes.

Thus, infection rate is not always a straightforward indicator of risk. Second, we used a model that simulated the process

of mosquito sampling, pooling, and virus testing and found that mosquito infection rates commonly underestimate the

prevalence of arbovirus infection in a mosquito population. Infection rate should always be used in conjunction with other surveillance indicators (mosquito population size, age structure, weather) and historical baseline data when assessing the risk of arbovirus transmission.},

Methods: A range of geo-environmental variables has been selected, and customized on GIS platform to develop GERM for identifying the areas of filariasis transmission in terms of "risk" and "non-risk". The model was validated through a 'ground truth study' following standard procedure using GIS tools for sampling and Immuno-chromotographic Test (ICT) for screening the individuals.

Results: A map for filariasis transmission was created and stratified into different spatial entities, "risk' and "non-risk", depending on Filariasis Transmission Risk Index (FTRI). The model estimation corroborated well with the ground (observed) data.

Conclusion: The geo-environmental risk model developed on GIS platform is useful for spatial delimitation purpose on a macro scale.},

Based on annual abundance patterns of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), species groups with similar ecological requirements were distinguished. Furthermore, we applied linear neural networks, general regression neural networks, modi&#64257;ed multi-layer perceptrons, and radial basis function networks combined with a SOM (RBFSOM) and successfully predicted the annual abundance of selected species from environmental variables. Results were visualised in three-dimensional plots. Relevance detection methods were sensitivity analysis, stepwise method and Genetic Algorithms. Instead of a sliding windows approach we computed the in- and output data of &#64257;xed periods for two caddis &#64258;ies. In order to assess the quality of the models we applied several reliability measures and compared the generalisation error with the long-term mean of the target variable. RBFSOMs were used to denominate and visualise local and general model accuracy. Results were interpreted on the basis of known species traits. We  onclude that it is possible to predict the abundance of aquatic insects based on relevant environmental factors using arti&#64257;cial neural networks.},

  abstract = {Ecological systems are generally considered among the most complex because they are characterized by a large number of diverse components, nonlinear interactions, scale multiplicity, and spatial heterogeneity. Hierarchy theory, as well as empirical evidence, suggests that complexity often takes the form of modularity in structure and functionality. Therefore, a hierarchical perspective can be essential to understanding complex ecological systems. But, how can such hierarchical approach help us with modeling spatially heterogeneous, nonlinear dynamic systems like landscapes, be they natural or human-dominated? In this paper, we present a spatially explicit hierarchical modeling approach to studying the patterns and processes of heterogeneous landscapes. We first discuss the theoretical basis for the modeling approach-the hierarchical patch dynamics (HPD) paradigm and the scaling ladder strategy, and then describe the general structure of a hierarchical urban landscape model (HPDM-PHX) which is developed using this modeling approach. In addition, we introduce a hierarchical patch dynamics modeling platform (HPD-MP), a software package that is designed to facilitate the development of spatial hierarchical models. We then illustrate the utility of HPD-MP through two examples: a hierarchical cellular automata model of land use change and a spatial multi-species population dynamics model.},

In this study, we build on principles of classical mathematical epidemiology to investigate spatial heterogeneity of disease risk for vector-borne diseases. Land cover delineates habitat suitability for vectors, and land use determines the spatial distribution of humans. We focus on the risk of exposure for dengue transmission on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, where the vector Aedes albopictus is well established and areas of dense human population exist. In Hawai'i, dengue virus is generally absent, but occasionally flares up when introduced. It is therefore relevant to investigate risk, but difficult to do based on disease incidence data. Based on publicly available data (land cover, land use, census data, surveillance mosquito trapping), we map the spatial distribution of vectors and human hosts and finally overlay them to produce a vector-to-host ratio map. The resulting high-resolution maps indicate a high spatial variability in vector-to-host ratio suggesting that risk of exposure is spatially heterogeneous and varies according to land cover and land use.},

  abstract = {Landfill siting is a difficult, complex, tedious, and protracted process requiring evaluation of many different criteria. This paper presents a fuzzy multicriteria decision analysis alongside with a geospatial analysis for the selection of landfill sites. It employs a two-stage analysis synergistically to form a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for waste management in a fast-growing urban region, south Texas. The first-stage analysis makes use of the thematic maps in Geographical information system (GIS) in conjunction with environmental, biophysical, ecological, and socioeconomic variables leading to support the second-stage analysis using the fuzzy multicriteria decision-making (FMCDM) as a tool. It differs from the conventional methods of integrating GIS with MCDM for landfill selection because the approach follows two sequential steps rather than a full-integrated scheme. The case study was made for the city of Harlingen in south Texas, which is rapidly evolving into a large urban area due to its vantage position near the US-Mexico borderlands. The purpose of GIS was to perform an initial screening process to eliminate unsuitable land followed by utilization of FMCDM method to identify the most suitable site using the information provided by the regional experts with reference to five chosen criteria. Research findings show that the proposed SDSS may aid in recognizing the pros and cons of potential areas for the localization of landfill sites in any study region. Based on initial GIS screening and final FMCDM assessment, "site 1" was selected as the most suitable site for the new landfill in the suburban area of the City of Harlingen. Sensitivity analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulation where the decision weights associated with all criteria were varied to investigate their relative impacts on the rank ordering of the potential sites in the second stage. Despite variations of the decision weights within a range of 20%, it shows that "site 1" remains its comparative advantage in the final site selection process.},

dynamics and environmental variables (discharge, temperature, precipitation, abundance of parental generation) in a small stream in central Germany. For data exploration, visualisation of data, outlier detection, hypothesis generation, and to detect basic patterns in the data, we used Kohonens self organizing maps (SOM). They are comparable to statistical cluster analysis by ordinating data into groups. Based on annual abundance patterns of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), species groups with similar ecological requirements were distinguished. Furthermore, we applied linear neural networks, general regression neural networks, modied multi-layer perceptrons, and radial basis function networks combined with a SOM (RBFSOM) and successfully predicted the annual abundance of selected species from environmental variables. Results were visualised in three-dimensional plots. Relevance detection methods were sensitivity analysis, stepwise method and Genetic Algorithms. Instead of a sliding windows approach we computed the in- and output data of xed periods for two caddis ies. In order to assess the quality of the models we applied several reliability measures and compared the generalisation error with the long-term mean of the target variable. RBFSOMs were used to denominate and visualise local and general model accuracy. Results were interpreted on the basis of known species traits. We  onclude that it is possible to predict the abundance of aquatic insects based on relevant environmental factors using articial neural networks.},

  abstract = {Background: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) depends upon Mass Drug Administration (MDA) to interrupt transmission. Therefore, delimitation of
transmission risk areas is an important step, and hence we attempted to define a geo-environmental risk model (GERM) for determining the areas of potential transmission of lymphatic filariasis.
Methods: A range of geo-environmental variables has been selected, and customized on GIS platform to develop GERM for identifying the areas of filariasis transmission in terms of "risk" and "non-risk". The model was validated through a 'ground truth study' following standard procedure using GIS tools for sampling and Immuno-chromotographic Test (ICT) for screening the individuals.
Results: A map for filariasis transmission was created and stratified into different spatial entities, "risk' and "non-risk", depending on Filariasis Transmission Risk Index (FTRI). The model estimation corroborated well with the ground (observed) data.
Conclusion: The geo-environmental risk model developed on GIS platform is useful for spatial delimitation purpose on a macro scale.},

It is assumed that when infection rate increases, the risk of arbovirus transmission to humans and animals also increases. We examined some of the factors that can invalidate this assumption. First, we used a model to illustrate how the proportion of mosquitoes capable of virus transmission, or infectious, is not a constant fraction of the number of infected mosquitoes.
Thus, infection rate is not always a straightforward indicator of risk. Second, we used a model that simulated the process
of mosquito sampling, pooling, and virus testing and found that mosquito infection rates commonly underestimate the
prevalence of arbovirus infection in a mosquito population. Infection rate should always be used in conjunction with other surveillance indicators (mosquito population size, age structure, weather) and historical baseline data when assessing the risk of arbovirus transmission.},

Methods: In each of six Asian cities or periurban areas, a team randomly selected urban clusters for conducting standardized household surveys, neighbourhood background surveys and entomological surveys. They collected information on vector breeding sites, peoples knowledge, attitudes and practices surrounding dengue, and the characteristics of the study areas. All premises were inspected; larval indices were used to quantify vector breeding sites, and pupal counts were used to identify productive water container types and as a proxy measure for adult vector abundance.
Findings: The most productive vector breeding sites were outdoor water containers, particularly if uncovered, beneath shrubbery and unused for at least one week. Peridomestic and intradomestic areas were much more important for pupal production than commercial and public spaces other than schools and religious facilities. A complex but non-significant association was found between water supply and pupal counts, and lack of waste disposal services was associated with higher vector abundance in only one site. Greater knowledge about dengue and its transmission was associated with lower mosquito breeding and production. Vector control measures (mainly larviciding in one site) substantially reduced larval and pupal counts and pushed mosquito breeding to alternative containers.
Conclusion: Vector breeding and the production of adult Aedes aegypti are influenced by a complex interplay of factors. Thus, to achieve effective vector management, a public health response beyond routine larviciding or focal spraying is essential.},

of the risk of human infectionthe rate at which people are bitten (human biting rate) and the proportion of
mosquitoes that are infectiousare positively correlated. In fact, these two risk factors are generated by different
processes and may be negatively correlated across space and time in heterogeneous environments. Uneven
distribution of blood-meal hosts and larval habitat creates a spatial mosaic of demographic sources and sinks.
Moreover, mosquito populations fluctuate temporally, forced by environmental variables such as rainfall, temperature,
and humidity. These sources of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the distribution of mosquito populations
generate variability in the human biting rate, in the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious, and in the risk of
human infection. To understand how heterogeneity affects the epidemiology of mosquito-borne infections, we
developed a set of simple models that incorporate heterogeneity in a stepwise fashion. These models predict that the human biting rate is highest shortly after the mosquito densities peak, near breeding sites where adult mosquitoes emerge, and around the edges of areas where humans are aggregated. In contrast, the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious reflects the age structure of mosquito populations; it peaks where old mosquitoes are found, far from mosquito breeding habitat, and when mosquito population density is declining. Finally, we show that estimates for the average risk of infection that are based on the average entomological inoculation rate are strongly biased in heterogeneous environments.},

SAMPLE POPULATION: Reports of skunks that had been submitted for rabies testing in Texas from 1953 through 2007. PROCEDURES: Reports were reviewed to obtain information on seasonality of rabies in skunks, seasonality of human and domestic animal exposure to rabid skunks, commonly reported clinical signs of rabies in skunks, domestic animals frequently exposed to rabid skunks, common scenarios for exposure of domestic animals to rabid skunks, disposition of domestic animals exposed to rabid skunks, age and gender of humans exposed to rabid skunks, and usual routes of exposure of humans to rabid skunks. RESULTS: On a yearly basis, the number of rabid skunks peaked in 1961, 1979, and 2001. On a monthly basis, the number of rabid skunks peaked in March and April. Over the study period, the percentage of rabid skunks from urban areas increased and the percentage from rural areas decreased. Striped skunks were the most common species. Dogs and cats were the domestic animals most frequently exposed to rabid skunks. On average, the highest numbers of humans exposed to rabid skunks were between 36 and 50 years old. Most humans were exposed through means other than a bite. Typical behaviors of rabid skunks were entering a dog pen, appearing outside during daytime, and attacking pets. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Information on the epidemiology of rabies in skunks may be useful in planning and implementing local, state, and national rabies control and prevention campaigns.},

  abstract = {Background Telemedical networks that apply innovative mobile information technologies (IT) are an innovative approach to improve stroke care in community settings. Within the German Stroke Angel initiative and the research project PerCoMed (Pervasive Computing in Medical Care, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, http://www.percomed.de) the effects of such a solution were assessed by an interdisciplinary research approach. The main goal of the team of researchers and practitioners was to provide clear evidence of improvements in intersectional processes of the stroke chain survival, namely in the acute stroke processes between prehospital rescue services and hospital stroke units. Material and methods Between October 2005 and October 2007 the paramedical staff of five rescue service transporters in a rural area of northern Bavaria was included in a network with the stroke unit of the Neurological Clinic Bad Neustadt. Telemedical support by the Stroke Angel computing system  a software running on a personal digital assistant (PDA) to transmit patient data from the rescue team to the hospital during patient transporting time  was established. As procedural guidance, the Stroke Angel system suggests a predefined path through the necessary emergency procedures according to the structure of the mandatory protocol and the implemented Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS). Results In the empirical study the authors obtained a complete data set of 226 consecutively admitted patients for analysis in Bad Neustadt and LAPSS data of 217 patients from a second scenario in D{\"u}sseldorf. Medical, economic and technical analyses were applied. The technological robustness of the Stroke Angel system could be proven and information entered was transmitted fully and correctly. Concerning medical research questions, for both scenario locations LAPSS with a sensitivity of 68.3% and a specificity of 85.1% has to be deemed insufficient. Hence, alternative algorithms will have to be used in the next steps of evaluation. The system significantly influenced the clinical process of acute stroke management more than the preclinical ones (door-to-CT: 32 min. before and 16 min. at the end of the project). Lysis treatment rose from 6.12% (2005) to 11.17% (2007) of patients with acute stroke. Conclusions From the set of perspectives taken, the study illustrates that mobile computing technologies offer new and innovative approaches to improve intersectional acute stroke care. It also teaches the participants that interdisciplinary research can significantly deepen the understanding of such technologies and projects, which can lead to better decision making concerning solution implementation, management and improvements. The approach will be brought into daily practice in Bad Neustadt/Saale within the next months.},
